analyzes sales data from an online retail dataset (online_retail_II.xlsx) spanning 2009-2011. It performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, with a focus on historical sales trends and forecasting. The code uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels to process the data and generate insights.
Features

    Data Loading: Combines sales data from two Excel sheets (2009-2010 and 2010-2011).
    Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, removes canceled invoices, and ensures proper data types.
    Data Transformation: Extracts year and month from invoice dates and calculates total sales.
    Visualization: Plots historical and forecasted sales trends (though forecasting logic is incomplete in the provided snippet).

Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you’ll need:

    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
    Required Python libraries:
        pandas
        numpy
        matplotlib
        seaborn
        statsmodels
        sklearn
    The dataset file: online_retail_II.xlsx (must be placed in the same directory as the notebook).

Install dependencies using pip:
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

Code Breakdown
1. Importing Libraries

The notebook starts by importing essential libraries for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization:
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
2. Loading Data

Loads data from two sheets of the Excel file and combines them into a single DataFrame:
python
df_2010 = pd.read_excel('online_retail_II.xlsx', sheet_name='Year 2010-2011')
df_2009 = pd.read_excel('online_retail_II.xlsx', sheet_name='Year 2009-2010')
df = pd.concat([df_2009, df_2010], ignore_index=True)
3. Data Cleaning

    Drops rows with missing values:
    python

df.dropna()
Removes canceled invoices (negative quantities):
python
df = df[df['Quantity'] > 0]
Converts InvoiceDate to datetime format:
python

    df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

4. Data Transformation

    Extracts Year and Month from InvoiceDate:
    python

df['Year'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.month
Calculates total sales per transaction:
python

    df['TotalSales'] = df['Price'] * df['Quantity']

5. Visualization (Incomplete)

The notebook includes a plot for historical and forecasted sales, but the monthly_sales and future_sales variables are not defined in the provided code. Assuming prior aggregation and forecasting (e.g., via ARIMA), the visualization code is:
python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(monthly_sales.index, monthly_sales["TotalSales"], label="Historical Sales", marker="o")
plt.plot(future_dates, future_sales, label="Forecasted Sales", linestyle="--", marker="x", color="red")
plt.title("Historical vs. Forecasted Sales")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Total Sales")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()

Note: To make this functional, you’d need to:

    Aggregate df['TotalSales'] by month (e.g., monthly_sales = df.groupby(['Year', 'Month'])['TotalSales'].sum()).
    Implement a forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA) to generate future_sales and future_dates.

How to Run

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-retail-analysis.git
cd online-retail-analysis
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure online_retail_II.xlsx is in the directory.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash

    jupyter notebook
    Open online_retail_sales_analysis.ipynb and run all cells.

Limitations

    The provided code snippet is incomplete (e.g., missing monthly_sales and future_sales definitions).
    The dataset (online_retail_II.xlsx) is not included, so users must source it separately (e.g., from the UCI Machine Learning Repository).
    Large Excel files may exceed GitHub’s file size limit (100 MB); consider hosting externally or using .gitignore.

Future Improvements

    Add time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) to predict future_sales.
    Include statistical analysis (e.g., seasonal decomposition).
    Enhance visualizations with interactive plots (e.g., Plotly).
